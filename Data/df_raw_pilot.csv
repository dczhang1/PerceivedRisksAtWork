Study Title: Risk Perception of Workplace Behaviors

2. Purpose of the Study and Study Procedures: The purpose of this project is to understand how constructive deviance work behaviors are perceived. This study consists of an online questionnaire that will take approximately 8 minutes to complete. The survey will include demographic items and questions regarding the perceived risk of different behaviors. 
 
3. Risks: Risks associated with this study are low and no more than risks that would be encountered in one’s daily activities. The nature of the questions is non-invasive. The act of answering questions via the online survey is no riskier than other computer-based online activities. 

4. Benefits: You may benefit from participating in this study by contributing to scientific research and by gaining increased insight into your thoughts about workplace behaviors. 
 


5. Investigators: Katelyn May Reeves (Ph.D. student) may be reached at kreev16@lsu.edu. Dr. Don Zhang (Louisiana State University) may be reached at zhang1@lsu.edu. The investigators may be reached 8:00 AM-5:00 PM M-F (CST). 

6. Performance Site: The study will be conducted online, however, both investigators will be involved with the research process from their respective locations. 

7. Number of subjects: 200 

8. Subject Inclusion: Participants must be 18 years old or older and work 30+ hours per week.

9. Subject Exclusion: Participants will be excluded if they are younger than 18 years old or work less than 30 hours per week.

10. Privacy: All data will be kept confidential unless release is legally compelled. The information will be stored in an encrypted and/or password protected file. As this study is being conducted through (Prolific), there will be no identifying information collected at any point. 

11. Financial Information: Upon completion of the survey, participants will be compensated $1.00. Payment will be distributed to participants through Prolific. 

12. Right to Refuse: Participants may choose not to participate or to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If a participant chooses to withdraw, they will lose the opportunity for compensation and should notify the investigators via email. 

13. Consent: I agree that the study has been discussed with me and all my questions have been answered. I may direct any additional questions regarding study specifics to the investigators. For injury or illness, call your physician. If I have questions about the subject's rights or other concerns, I can contact Alex Cohen, Chairman, LSU Institutional Review Board, (225) 578-8692, irb@lsu.edu, or www.lsu.edu/research. I agree to participate in the study described above.
